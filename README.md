###Express

####Web Applications
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. 

####APIs
With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.

####Performance
Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.

####LoopBack
Develop model-driven apps with an Express-based framework.
